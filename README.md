<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![GoingsOn Screen Shot](screenshotImageHere)](https://goingson.netlify.app)

This is currently in development. This application is designed to be a web app companion to a mobile app. This web app is designed to allow business owners to create an account and a profile for their business with their daily and weekly specials as well as their special events. Business owners can also search existing specials in our database to research their competition on given days of the week.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This application is deployed ![here](https://goingson.netlify.app).

### Prerequisites

You would need a good understanding of React, MongoDB, Node, Express, and Bootstrap.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tsbolty/GoingsOn.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

You can see all businesses as well as filter all specials without logging in. If you would like to log in, you can then create a profile for your business and enter your daily and weekly specials. You can then edit your profile as well as create a special event for your business that will be advertised for you.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

There is a lot of potential to add features such as expanding the profile section to include profile pictures, themes, more specific categories, and reviews. We would also be able to eventually crowd-source these specials or at lease allow our users to confirm or dispute any specials on our platform.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, that would be very much welcome. Feel free to add any feature you would like on the front end or the back end. You will need to be proficient in JavaScript, MongoDB, React, Express, Node and Bootstrap.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
